# total derivative's sufficient condition

全导数的充分条件是，如果一个函数在某个点处的所有偏导数都存在且连续，那么该函数在该点处就是可微的，且其全微分就等于其所有偏导数的线性组合。

The total derivative of a function exists if all partial derivatives exist and are continuous in the given domain. In other words, if the function is continuously differentiable in the domain, then the total derivative exists. This condition is also known as the sufficient condition for the existence of total derivative.
