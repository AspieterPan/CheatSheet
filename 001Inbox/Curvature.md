# Curvature


## Define
---
曲率是描述曲线或曲面弯曲程度的物理量。在数学和物理学中，曲率可以用来衡量一个对象在某一点上的弯曲程度，并且通常被表示为该点处的半径。当一个物体沿着某个路径运动时，它所受到的曲率会影响它的运动轨迹和速度。在数学中，曲率是微积分和微分几何中的重要概念，被广泛应用于建模和解决各种几何问题。

Curvature is a physical quantity that describes the degree of bending of a curve or surface. In mathematics and physics, curvature can be used to measure the degree of curvature of an object at a certain point, and is usually represented as the radius at that point. When an object moves along a certain path, the curvature it experiences will affect its trajectory and speed. In mathematics, curvature is an important concept in calculus and differential geometry, and is widely used for modeling and solving various geometric problems.

## Equation
---
$$ Curvature = \frac{|y''|}{[1+(y')^{2}]^{\frac{3}{2}}} $$
