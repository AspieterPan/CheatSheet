# Model Essay-On the Way

As is vividly portrayed in the cartoon, two people are climbing a mountain together. One of them sits on a higher step with his backpack beside his feet and complains, "I'm tired, so I don't want to climb anymore." However, his partner carrying a bag catches up with him and hands him a bottle of water, saying, "Come on! Take a break then continue to climb." Under the picture lies a caption: On the Way.

The impressive drawing has profoundly revealed that the process of our life is just like the mountain-climbing and only by adjusting our own pace and persisting in our goals can we reach a higher life realm. We had lots of dreams when we were kids, but few were realized. For one thing, all kinds of interference make us give up sticking to dreams. For another, we haven't integrated dreams into our life because of being anxious ofr success. The most common instance is that when we want to improve our heath or obtain a better figure, a majority of us may determine to do exercise, but often end in laziness and various excuses.

As the saying goes, "The end of man is the beginning of God, and only those who do their best can get the favor of heaven and enjoy the joy of victory." It is advisable for us, positive climbers, to view persistence and struggle as a lifestyle. May we enjoy the richness and beauty of life if we take the cognition into the action.
