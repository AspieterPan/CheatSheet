## Definition

if $\Delta z = f(x + \Delta x,y + \Delta y) -f(x,y)$ can be presented as $$\Delta z = A\Delta x + B\Delta y + o(\rho)$$
$\rho = \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2}$, then function $z = f(x,y)$ is differentiable at point $(x,y)$ , and total differential is $$dz = A\Delta x + B\Delta y$$
