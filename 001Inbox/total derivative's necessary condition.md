# Total Derivative's Necessary Condition
if function $z = f(x,y)$ is differentiable at point $(x,y)$ , then the [[Partial Derivative]]  $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}$ at point $(x,y)$  must exist, and $$dz = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}dy$$
