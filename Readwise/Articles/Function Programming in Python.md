## Highlights
---
- pyrsistent contains a number of immutable collections. All methods on a data structure that would normally mutate it instead return a new copy of the structure containing the requested updates. The original structure is left untouched. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgxb9sfh4v0hsr2k4yk086hf))

- toolz provides a set of utility functions for iterators, functions, and dictionaries. These functions interoperate well and form the building blocks of common data analytic operations. They extend the standard libraries itertools and functools and borrow heavily from the standard libraries of contemporary functional languages.

- • hypothesis is a library for creating unit tests for finding edge cases in your code you wouldn’t have thought to look for. It works by generating random data matching your specification and checking that your guarantee still holds in that case. This is often called property-based testing, and was popularized by the Haskell library QuickCheck. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgxb9yn1c99jw36wryrrcgqh))

- more_itertools tries to collect useful compositions of iterators that neither itertools nor the recipes included in its docs address. These compositions are deceptively tricky to get right and this well-crafted library helps users avoid pitfalls of rolling them themselves.
