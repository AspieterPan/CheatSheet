- When we state and solve recurrences, we often omit ﬂoors, ceilings, and bound- ary conditions. We forge ahead without these details and later determine whether or not they matter. They usually do not, but you should know when they do. Ex- perience helps, and so do some theorems stating that these details do not affect the asymptotic bounds of many recurrences characterizing divide-and-conquer algo- rithms (see Theorem 4.1). In this chapter, however, we shall address some of these details and illustrate the ﬁne points of recurrence solution methods.
