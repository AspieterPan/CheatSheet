# How to Tag Your Highlights While You Read

## Highlights
---
- Simply highlight a passage and add a note beginning with a period (`.`) followed by a single word or abbreviation (with no spaces).
  For example, let's say you're interested in the subject of probability and you come across a thought-provoking passage describing the difficulty of defining what probability actually means. You want to save this passage for later, so you highlight it. You also want to attach the keyword "probability" so when you see this passage again, you know immediately what it's about. To use inline tagging, simply add the note `.probability` in addition to the highlight. When it's imported into Readwise, the passage will be tagged accordingly.

- In practice, you might not want to type out the full word `.probability` because typing without a keyboard can be frustrating. To help you type less, we created a shorthand feature. In the example above, you could note the passage `.prob` instead of `.probability`. The highlight would initially be tagged `prob`, but once you rename the shorthand a single time, Readwise will thereafter be trained to automatically convert to all `.prob` tags to `.probability`.

- For example, in Part 3 of the tutorial series [How to Actually Use What You Read](https://blog.readwise.io/reading-workflow-part-3/), I described the versatile tag of `.i` (shorthand for `.inbox`) which I use to prioritize actionable highlights that I want to see soon, rather than someday resurfaced in my daily review.
