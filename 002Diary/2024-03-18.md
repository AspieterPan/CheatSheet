- 22:41 #Mbti/Fi #Mbti/Si<br>So much time I wasted.<br>I haven't studied anything since I took the PG exam. I was tired and had a severe cold after I knew my scores, which took ten days from me.<br>The life of not studying anything doesn't make me happier; I am exhausted.<br>Now I'm waiting for the news on whether I can take the reexamine. I expect I can't because there is not enough time for me to prepare even if I can.
