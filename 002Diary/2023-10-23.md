- 23:00 I believe I should cultivate the habit of keeping memos. Documenting my thoughts is crucial, and I've chosen to do so in English to enhance my writing skills.<br><br>Last week was not productive for me. I found myself distracted, unable to concentrate on my studies, and constantly tempted by games and social media. I suspect that my sleep patterns played a significant role in this. My focus was optimal until one night when I slept exceptionally late. The detrimental effects lingered for about a week, underscoring the importance of maintaining a healthy sleep routine.<br><br>Recently, I've been contemplating the workflow in Obsidian. I'm familiar with other people's workflows, such as [IOTO](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv26433806) and [3 年、4 个库目录、100 万字：也谈我的 Obsidian 笔记工作流](https://sspai.com/post/83042). Both emphasize the significance of producing output. My plan is to categorize my Obsidian notes into three sections: Inbox, CPU, and Output.<br><br>The Inbox folder will store all informational cards, like excerpts from websites or books. These cards remain objective and cite their sources. <br><br>The Output section will house essays suitable for public sharing, regardless of whether I choose to publish them. These essays are intended for a broad audience, even those unfamiliar with the topic. Essentially, they are polished products.<br><br>The CPU section, a name still under consideration, bridges the Inbox and Output. Cards within the CPU are sorted by their respective output projects. For instance, if I aim to compose a series of essays assisting others in understanding Vim, I would create a "101 for Vim" folder within the CPU. Using Dataview, I can filter all Vim-related cards from the Inbox. The Task feature will allow me to oversee the progress of the entire project and outline each essay. However, the intricacies within the CPU remain behind the scenes and are not essential for the Output's readership. This structure offers me the freedom to employ various knowledge gathering and project management techniques within the CPU. ^n8lpbm
