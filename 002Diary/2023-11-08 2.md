- 00:03 Another week has slipped by unproductively. Last week, I accomplished almost nothing study-related, not even basic tasks like reviewing English vocabulary.<br><br>The source of this slump, I believe, was depression. I couldn't stop myself from indulging in video games, perusing trivial messages, oversleeping, and, worst of all, overeating. It may have started with a minor disagreement. Two weeks ago, Fei was emotionally unstable, easily brought to tears by the slightest of concerns, and seeking my constant companionship. As much as I tried to console her, the pressure also weighed on me, leaving me frustrated by the incessant need to provide comfort.<br><br>This bottled-up turmoil has left me feeling overwhelmed, unable to confide in anyoneâ€”not even Fei, considering her delicate state. The symptoms of depression were unmistakable: a disconnection from reality and an inability to plan or manage any aspect of my life.<br><br>It wasn't until today that this fog lifted, perhaps due to the coffee I drank this morning or the music that accompanied my math studies. Regardless, I am now lucid and acutely aware that I have just 45 days left to prepare. In 45 days, I'll sit for the exam, regardless of how well-prepared I am. It's distressing to realize that I've squandered 10 days, a fifth of the remaining time.<br><br>A month ago, I was brimming with confidence, but as the exam looms closer, my self-assurance dwindles. I've made no discernible progress and am uncertain about how to proceed. All that's left is to give my utmost effort in the days ahead.
