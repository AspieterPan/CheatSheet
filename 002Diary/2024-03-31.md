- 16:25 #Mbti/Fe <br>Learning Rust is extremely helpful for engineering abilities.<br>- Concepts like "exceptions," "project organization," "automated testing," "concurrency," etc., are detailed in Rust tutorials,<br>	- Meanwhile, when learning other languages, they are often glossed over or merely presented as functional syntax.<br>- Not to mention, many of Rust's syntaxes are best practices in C++ engineering.<br>- Therefore, learning Rust is still highly beneficial, even if one intends to use something other than Rust for future projects.
